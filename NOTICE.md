# Third Party Code

Some of the code featured here has been borrowed from the LUCENE / SOLR project that can be found at https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr.
Code present in the package com.francelabs.datafari.similarity.base are direct copies of classes from the LUCENE libraries that I needed to do because of some field visible only in package.
The rest of the code is inspired from existing classes of LUCENE / SOLR that have been modified to implement the new similarity.
